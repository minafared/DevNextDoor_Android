The app shows blog posts from [DevNextDoor](http://devnextdoor.com) which is my Blog where I share tech tutorials and thoughts on various topics.
It consumes REST API of the above said blog. (More on that [here](http://devnextdoor.com/2016/11/29/using-retrofit-with-jackson-converter-in-android/))

This app is used as a reference in my [Android Tutorial Series](http://devnextdoor.com/tag/android/) for beginners to get familiar with Android.
I myself am learning a lot by developing this app and intend to develop it further.
